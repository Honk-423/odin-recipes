                <li>1 small tomato, finely diced</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin</li>
                <li>red pepper flaes, to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup or 4 oz can of chopped green chiles, fire roasted</li>
                <li>1/2 cup or 4 oz can of chopped red chiles, fire roasted</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of red and yellow bell peppers, diced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of jalapeños</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare and sort ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a large saucepan or small pot.</li>
            <li>Add onion and cook slowly for three minutes, or until the onion is translucent but not browned.</li>
            <li>Add tomato and peppers (excluding the jalapeños) and cook until softened.</li> 
            <li>Mix the cornstarch with a tablespoon of water. Then add evaporated milk, cheese, and the cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Stir then add the spices and jalapeños. Continue to mix until the cheese melts and becomes a somewhat thick sauce.</li>
            <li>Stir in two tablespoons of milk to adjust consistency. The dip will thicken when cooled, more milk can be added then to reach preferred consistency.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
